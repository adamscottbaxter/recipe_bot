# Golang Trade Bot

## How this project started

I had been wanting to explore a new language while at the same time had an idea for a crypto trading bot in the back of my mind. Decided to tackle both as a quarterly goal I've set up with some work friends.

## What I learned

Basic go syntax, functions, and conventions. Go is a compiled language with strict types, and coming from a Ruby background, I enjoyed the quick feedback I received when passing in an incorrect argument or returning something unexpected.

## Further development goals

I'll be moving on to another trading strategy soon, but looking to utilize channels, testing, and improve my error handling.

## Acknowledgements

A hat tip to Jake for helping me with the SQL connection on Heroku.
